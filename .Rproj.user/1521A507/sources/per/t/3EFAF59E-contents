This course is an introduction to philosophical questions about law, legal reasoning and the justice system. 
The course is divided into three parts:

1. **Law and interpretation** --  What makes a written text a piece of law? What principles inform the writing of laws? Are laws mere human conventions? How should judges decide difficult cases?

2. **Law and morality** --  Are laws grounded on moral and ethical principles? Should we obey immoral laws? Why should we obey the law in the first place? 

3. **Algoriths and the justice system** -- How are algorithms used in the justice system today? Can they improve the justice system? Do they pose a threat?
